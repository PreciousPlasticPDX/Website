Plastics in trash is a big problem in our society. We aim to empower the children in our community by including them in a solution. We will build a mobile plastic recycling center where we use plastics that would have ended up in the local trash stream as a raw material for new, valuable items. We will focus on including PPS students to help collect plastics, design and make items, and promote this recycling center to the public.  We aim to change the way students see trash.

### Our Goal

 * Build a Mobile Precious Plastics Recycling Center.
 * Get students involved in the process.
 * Turn plastic trash into valuable items.
